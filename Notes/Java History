*** History of Java ***
> Java was introduced by James Gosling.
> Java was introduced by Sun Micro Systems.
> Current owner of the java is Oracle.
> Previous name of Java is Oak.

*** Why Java? Features of Java ***
1) Java is simple language because syntax of java is very easy.
2) Java is platform independent means we can run Java Application in any OS.
3) Java is object oriented programming language means based on real world entities we will develop applications.
4) Java is extensible means Java can interact with any other programming language.
5) Java is robust means we can develop huge applications (complex applications) in Java.
6) Java has automatic garbage collector which will clear the memory after execution of the application.

*** Steps to run Java program ***
> Create a file 
> Compilation
> Execution 

# Create a file :- 
-> With the help of editors create a file along with a extension '.java'.
-> Inside the file we can have 2 things : 1) Class & 2) Interface

# Compilation :-
-> To compile Java program we need software called 'Compiler'.
-> Compiler is also known as Javac.
-> Compiler will take .java file as a input & read it the code line by line.
-> If there is mistake with syntax, Compiler will throw back the file to the devloper to debug the code.
-> If there are 0 errors then compiler will generate one more file '.class' file which contains byte code.
** Byte Code ** :- Byte code is nothing but the itermediate programming language both huamn and machine cannot understand.

# Execution :- 
-> To execute Java program we need Software called JRE.
-> JRE stands for "Java Runtime Environment"
-> Java will take '.class' file as a input.

# Printing Statements 
1) System.out.print() :- It will print the data and holds the curser in same line.
2) System.out.println() :- It will print the data and shift the cursor to next line.
