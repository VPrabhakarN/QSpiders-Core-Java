*** Variable *** 
-> Variable is nothing but a container or block of memory which is used to store data.
-> Syntax -
           // Variable declaration and initialization
           Datatype Identifier = Value;
  ex.        int       age     = 1923;

-> Advantages of variable :-
   > To store or fetch the data is very easy.
   > We can re-assign the value for n number of time.

-> Disadvantages :- 
   > Within variable we can store single value.
